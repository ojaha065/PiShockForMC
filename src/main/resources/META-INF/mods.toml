PiShock Shock Collar Integration for Minecraft

This simple client-only mod allows players to connect their PiShock device to the game for some added stakes. Whenever the player takes damage, they will get a corresponding shock, the intensity of which can be configured and will scale up based on the amount of damage taken.

For detailed setup instructions and configuration, please refer to the GitHub page.

We kindly urge you to prioritize safety, understand your personal and other's limitations, and exercise caution at all times.
